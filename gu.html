        happiest birthday to you, jigu >< 
        you know I'm not good with words, 
        but despite that, i want to express 
        my adoration and appreciation for you. 
        i never imagined I'd start this year 
        unexpectedly with an amazing human being, 
        but I'm glad i did. it's kinda funny 
        since we've only known each other for 
        less than a month, but I feel like I've
        known you for months, which is amazing. 
        thank you for existing in this world; 
        a sunshine like u deserve to be even happier 
        and I hope life will be kinder to you.
        also if you give me permission, i 
        would like to make more memories with 
        you... anyway, happiest birthday again, jo !!
      </p>
